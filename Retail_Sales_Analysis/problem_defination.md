Many businesses invest in marketing activities, pricing adjustments, and discount strategies with the expectation of increasing sales revenue. However, without a clear understanding of how much each factor contributes to revenue growth, such decisions may lead to inefficient allocation of resources and reduced return on investment.

In this project, historical sales data is analyzed to quantify the impact of key business factors such as marketing spend, pricing, customer volume, and discounts on sales revenue. A multiple linear regression approach is used to model these relationships, as it provides interpretable coefficient-based insights that help explain how changes in each factor influence revenue.

The primary objective of this analysis is to support data-driven business decision-making by identifying the most influential revenue drivers and enabling better planning of marketing budgets and pricing strategies.
